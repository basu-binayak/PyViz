# Python Data Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh : PyViz

Welcome to the Python Data Visualization Tools repository! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of three popular Python visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh.

## Overview
Hi there! We will explore three powerful Python libraries for data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh. By the end, you will have a robust understanding of various plot types and customization techniques, allowing you to create insightful and interactive visualizations.

## Libraries Covered
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Bokeh

## Plot Types and Graphs
We will cover a variety of plots and graphs, including but not limited to:
- Line Plots
- Scatter Plots
- Bar Charts
- Histograms
- Marginal Histograms
- Box Plots
- Area Plots
- Violin Plots
- Strip Plots
- Heat Maps
- Pair Plots
- Calendar Plots
- Bubble Plots
- Error Bars
- Swarm Plots
- Cluster Plots
- Regression Lines

## Data Preparation and Analysis
Understanding the importance of data preparation for visualization, we will delve into:
- Data manipulation techniques
- Use of NumPy and Pandas for data structuring
- Bokehâ€™s Column Data Source and applying filters
- Data generation using NumPy

## Advanced Techniques
We will also explore advanced visualization and machine learning techniques, such as:
- Interactive plots with widgets and controls using Bokeh
- Integration with Google Maps API for geographic data visualization
- Linear regression and clustering for data analysis and visualization
- Pixel matrix representations for image visualization

## Customization and Parameterization
Each visualization technique will be complemented by in-depth customization options, allowing you to:
- Customize plot attributes
- Parameterize various plot elements
- Adapt visualizations to complex data scenarios

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each library, containing Jupyter notebooks and scripts for different plot types and techniques:
- `Matplotlib/`
- `Seaborn/`
- `Bokeh/`
- `Data_Preparation/`
- `Advanced_Techniques/`

Each folder includes detailed examples and use cases, ensuring you can follow along and implement the techniques in your own projects.
